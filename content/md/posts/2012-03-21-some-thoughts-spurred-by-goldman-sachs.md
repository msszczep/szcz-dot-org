[The bridge-burning op-ed by Goldman Sachs employee Greg Smith](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?pagewanted=all\") has spurred a great deal of commentary. But [this blog post in particular](http://remarkedly.com/2012/03/15/goldman-sachs-is-a-harbinger-of-american-decline/) piqued my interest. Some choice quotes:  

> "This is not how capitalism is supposed to work. This is not "creative
destruction" -- Schumpeter's vision of entrepreneurs disrupting inefficient
systems and profiting from making them better -- this is simply the enrichment
of a few smart, lucky men at the expense of everyone else.  
Theoretically, investment banks help allocate capital towards its most
efficient use. They help governments and companies raise money, they help with
mergers and acquisitions, and they create securities which should distribute
risks or at least give clients more choices about the risks they take. But in
reality, up to 80% of M&A; destroys value, opaque securities have created
endemic risks in our society, and there are astounding conflicts of interests
between clients and investment bankers -- the very same bank that is floating
your company's shares has a long term relationship with the hedge funds who
are purchasing the stock. Who is the bank really serving?  
It's not clear what has caused this system or how to get out of it. It's not
just because corporate boards want to use the "top tier" firms to avoid
potential litigation: the Big Four audit firms have an oligopoly which they
don't seem to be abusing to the same degree. Has capitalism changed somehow?
Has America simply stopped creating real wealth in other areas of society so
the only thing to do now is to constantly shuffle it around in Manhattan?

I have three things to say:  
  
(1) Regarding "this is not how capitalism is supposed to work" that instead
of "Schumpeter's vision of entrepreneurs disrupting inefficient systems and
profiting from making them better", were left with "the enrichment of a few
smart, lucky men at the expense of everyone else". Maybe it's not how
capitalism is _supposed_ to work in some idealized sense, but it's pretty
evident that this is how it _does_ work. The main economic allocator in
capitalism, markets, are competitive realms, so while one can compete on
honest grounds to profit, it's also possible (and arguably easier and far more
common) to compete on _dis_honest grounds to profit (the elaboration of which
sounds like the topic of its own blog post). Given that context, the rational
response is to behave like a monster, seeking everything for oneself and
nothing for anyone else, undercutting your opponents before they undercut you.
And the most honed institutional form of that kill-or-be-killed ethos is the
limited-liability corporation, like Goldman Sachs.  
  
(2) "It's not clear what has caused this system". On the contrary, I think
it is clear -- the result of selective pressures stemming from the sacrosanct
status of markets. As mentioned above, markets tend to select those
institutions like corporations that thrive in competitive realms. But the
"winners" from that competitive realm can't behave nicely in internal
operations, lest they get undercut by opponents in the market who _don't_
behave like that. That's why markets also select for not only for psychopaths
as institutions but those _people_ who exhibit psychopathic behavior who also
thrive in competitive realms. And when profit streams done by legitimate means
dry up, those institutions (and the people in them) take on more extreme
measures in order to get their profit fix.  
  
(3) "It's not clear how to get out of it." I actually agree with part of
this statement, but just one part. I think we know what the "it" in "how to
get out of _it_" is -- get rid of markets and replace them with a more sane
allocation system (I recommend the participatory planning system of
[participatory economics](http://www.parecon.org)) -- so I disagree in
that sense. But I would agree somewhat in that we don't know the full details
of the _how_ part -- what tactics to deploy in what combination to achieve
"it". I [have recommended various specific tactics](http://www.szcz.org/article/356), but they are all predicated
on the idea of building awareness in one capacity or another and ultimately
convincing enough minds so that we reach what [recent research has found to be a minimum 10% threshold](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110725190044.htm) to achieving critical mass for an idea to take hold in a
society. It could be a magic bullet, but it could (and likely would) also be a
variety of approaches working separately or in tandem to help build that
threshold.
