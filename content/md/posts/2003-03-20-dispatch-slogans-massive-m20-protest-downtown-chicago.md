{:title "Dispatch (and slogans) from massive M20 protest in downtown Chicago"

In the wake of the historic M20 rally and march, a follow-up antiwar rally
with even more protesters--and a far larger police presence--took place in
Federal Plaza on March 21, 2003, followed by a march through downtown Chicago.

The police presence was massive right away at M21. Coordinated fleets of
hundreds of helmeted police on foot surrounded Federal Plaza from the
scheduled beginning of the rally, accompanied by a full array of police on
horseback (one protester said "Get those animals off those horses!"), plus
five buses that didn't make an appearance until late the police attack on
Thursday.

I don't mean to disparage the Chicago Police Department (well, yes I do,
considering their wanton beatings and mass arrests on M20), but given the
intimidating police presence on M21, I couldn't help but think of the words
"Berlin" and "1930s".

The M20 events were heavily scripted. After a scheduled one hour rally, the
march began with police continually surrounding the protesters (which spanned
more than three city blocks and encompassed an estimated 15,000 to perhaps
30,000 people), effectively serving as a giant cage. The front and rear of the
march were flanked by police buses.

The route of the march was as follows: from Federal Plaza, north on Dearborn
to Wacker, then west on Wacker, then (oh crap! I don't remember the rest of
the route! Help!), and finally returning to Federal Plaza, at about 8:30 pm.

Many of the protest signs that appeared M20 appeared again on M21. Here are
some signs that (at least to me) made their first appearance on M21:

Against the War, Not the Cops  
Buy Haliburton stock now! Cheney's counting on huge returns!  
Can the Troops Go to Camp David?  
How's This a Democracy if we the people have no say-so?  
I'm in Shock, not in Awe  
If you want peace, better do somethin' 'bout that Bush  
Laura, we're worried about George  
Sorry, George. Jesus was in fact a peacemaker.  
There are no warlike people, just warlike leaders. -- Ralph Bunche  
This Ain't No Focus Group  
War Without End? Maybe so...  
Who's Next?  

These and more than 260 other protest signs are in the Protest Slogans
Database at the Chicago Media Action website.

Unrelated Update: I called WGN Radio earlier this evening (they were talking
about protests and rallies), and I mentioned the Chicago IMC website on the
air. Yay!
