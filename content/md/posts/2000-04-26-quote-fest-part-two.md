internet, an example of how massive publishing power is in the hands of anyone

The best science fiction, from "Frankenstein" on, has, perversely, always
been about how beside the point science is--how it can't, ultimately, solve
the Big Problems, because however sophisticated technology gets, human nature
always stays pretty much the same.  
**--Daniel Mendelsohn, in a review of Michael Crichton's "Timeline" in the November 21, 1999 New York TImes Book Review**

Practically everybody wants to give up their amateur standing as soon as
possible. The irony is that if most writers of poetry and other dabblers would
think entirely of the benefit to them and not at all of publication, the
publishable merit of what they produce would be greatly and constantly
increased.  
**--Northrop Frye, 1996 journal entry**

why failure in climbing one mountain, whether in music or in prose, may be
success in climbing an unforeseen neighboring peak.

Think of how much human life has changed over the past two thousand years,
with the development of science, the advent of universities, global
communications and transportation, and the freeing of millions from ignorance,
tyranny and an early grave. Then extrapolate that on a rising curve. Of

rise too. Either way, we're going to get what we deserve.  
**--Timothy Ferris**

Modern life has made waiting a desperate act.  
**--Noelle Denlandler, July 16, 1997 New Yorker**

Pain concentrates the mind, but what it concentrates the mind on is pain.  
**--Margaret Talbot, New York Times, October 31, 1999**

We become scientists for the same reasons that people become artists--it is in
our blood, a dream, a desire, a way of approaching the world. If we can
communicate that feeling to nonscientists, we will all be enriched.  
**--Frances Hellman**

Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is
everything else.  
**--Donald Knuth, in the November 1999 issue of Wired**

This business [the entertainment industry] is amazingly fair--unless you
happen to be Asian, black, Hispanic, gay or a woman.

The human condition: that's one piece of machinery that seems not to get
upgraded. The human brain is still operating at version 1.0: look at road
rage, white supremacists, ATM scams, religious tunnelvision, macho idiot gun-
love, and look at who we have up for president. Not to mention the upcoming
Scopes Monkey Trial of the Year 2000 in that jerkwater state Kansas. Change?
Learn? Evolve? Not bloody likely.  
**--Harlan Ellison**

thousand years.  
**--Richard L. Phillips, in a December 31, 1999 letter to the New York Times**

The kind of intelligence most valued in American society today is the
intelligence needed to persuade other people that you are really intelligent.
We have discovered that it takes brains to seem brainy.  
**--Louis Menand, in the New York Times magazine, about Clifton Fadiman**

In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer
anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.  
**--Saint-Exupery**

An attack on evolution is an attack on all science. Discredit that, and the
next generation may wonder why they should support science at all.  
**--Eugene Scott, of the National Center for Science Education, in the April 22, 2000 New Scientist**

What is the myth you are living?  
**--Carl Jung**

Some people say things better than I, so I quote them.
