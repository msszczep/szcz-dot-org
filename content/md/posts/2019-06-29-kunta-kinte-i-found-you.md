Whenever I find something, usually in the context of looking for the source of a computer
bug, I tend to say the same quote:

_"Kunta Kinte, I found you."_

Kunta Kinte was the ancestor of Alex Haley.  Haley had traced his ancestry all the way back
to that of a young man from what's now The Gambia, who was sized by slave traders, brought
aboard the Lord Ligonier to the Americas, sold, and lived out his life as a slave.

Seven generations later, Alex Haley, the writer known for _The Autobiography of Malcolm X_,
searched for his ancestry and wrote about it in the book _Roots_, which was adapted into
a highly popular pair of TV miniseries.  

I watched all the episodes of the first miniseries, and bits and pieces of the second.
I did watch the final episode of the second miniseries, where Alex Haley went to the Gambia
and heard confirmation from an oral historian of his great-great-great-great-grandfather.
He checked his notes and yelled out with joy:

"_I found you!  Kunta Kinte, I found you!_"

I made a gif of that very scene at the top of this post.  I almost instinctually say that
phrase whenever I find something that takes a long time to find (and that happens in
software development a _lot_).  It's my go-to-phrase for a successful search.
