{:title "A health risk to being vegan?"

Today marks my 26th veganniversary -- I had my last non-vegan meal on this date (September 14th) in 1993 and I've been on the vegan bandwagon ever since.  For the first time since I've been vegan, [there is research](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49579820) (that I know of) saying there is a _negative_ health risk to this diet: a slight increase of the likelihood of having a stroke among vegans (and vegetarians) as compared to meat eaters or fish eaters.

How much does this research change the overall calculus?  Like I said, this marks the first time I've ever heard of a health risk being found regarding a vegan diet, and the needle hasn't changed (as far as I know) regarding the myriad other impacts on health and the environment.  For me, for now, the benefits still outweigh the negatives, and I haven't been convinced enough to leave the vegan bandwagon.  That could change (I frankly doubt it, but you never know) -- and being open-minded and keeping aware and letting the science guide one's choices are still, for me, the best approach.
