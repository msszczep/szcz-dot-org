This is [Six](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Number_Six):

Six a humanoid Cylon played by Canadian actress Tricia Helfer in the [remade Battlestar Galactica series](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Portal:Battlestar_Galactica_%28RDM%29).  
  
And this is also [Six](http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/six-game):

Six is also a board game where players take different-colored hexagons to make
either a six-sided ring or a triangle made from hexagons or a line of six
hexagons in a row -- and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same.  
  
So last Christmas, I got for my cousin Stefanie (who I knew was a fan of the
remade Battlestar Galactica) a copy of the board game Six, but wrapped like
this:

Clever, eh? (The gift, and the way it was wrapped, was a big hit.)
