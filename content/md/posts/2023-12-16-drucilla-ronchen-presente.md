In 1982, I attended a party to celebrate my cousin's First Holy Communion.  It was at that party that I was introduced to a book (I later found out this book was "<a href="https://archive.org/details/joyofsigningillu00riek/page/n1/mode/2up">The Joy of Signing</a>") that demonstrated a language using your hands, arms, and body -- American Sign Language (ASL).  I thought this was just the coolest thing, and for about a year or so thereafter I explored it some with other books I found, including one featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Bove">Linda from Sesame Street</a>.  My work on ASL would wane, but I vowed to myself that someday somehow I would learn ASL.

Fast forward to 1996; I'm about to start graduate school.  I was fortunate that (A) ASL was offered as a credited course, (B) it fulfilled a degree requirement, (C) I was able to enroll in a class, and (D) it helped me fulfill the vow I made to myself so many years earlier.  My teacher was Drucilla Ronchen -- Drucie as she was called -- and I took a year-long sequence in ASL.  I learned enough ASL to be conversationally competent, I visited [the Chicago Club of the Deaf](http://www.chicagoclubdeaf.org/index.html), I attended an ASL conference, I saw some [ASL theatre](https://howlround.com/american-sign-language-theatre-and-its-impact-or-why-we-need-more-deaf-actors-onstage), I had a conversation through soundproof glass, [I had gotten a name sign](http://www.szcz.org/posts/2020-10-31-story-name-sign/), and I had served as an interpreter for Drucie at a get-together.

I had the opportunity to use ASL over the years in various random locales -- on a bus in Chicago, at Los Angeles International Airport, at a conference where I represented the news program Democracy Now!  Drucie and I even ran into each other in passing over the years; she once taught me the ASL sign for "cancer" after I told her I had a family member who was diagnosed.

In late 2023 at a venue north of Chicago, I had met a Deaf couple who were signing (to respect their privacy, I will decline to mention them by name here).  It was the first time I had occasion to practice my ASL skills with other people in person since the COVID-19 pandemic.  We got to talking about each other's children, about where we lived, why I learned ASL, and how I learned ASL.  I had known about variations in ASL signs -- the ASL signs for "football" are a classic example; indeed, in our conversation I learned a different ASL sign variant for "Chicago".  

I had mentioned Drucie and they knew Drucie (of course _everyone_ knew Drucie), and then they broke the news to me that Drucie had died.  I was shocked; I didn't know and started to cry and asked them for a hug which they graciously obliged.  They weren't sure when she died -- maybe five years ago?  They then mentioned a sign I didn't recognize but which I inferred later was another variant sign for "cancer".

I later found out that [Drucie passed away in 2021](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/chicagotribune/name/drucilla-ronchen-obituary?id=4700547).  I'm still sad over the news, but I'm grateful I got the chance to know Drucie and to learn from her.  Thank you, Drucie, for all that you have done.

Drucilla Ronchen, presente!
