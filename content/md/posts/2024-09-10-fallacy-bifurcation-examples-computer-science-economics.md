On September 4, 2024, I gave a presentation for [Power Point Night](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-HCx-XRKL5/) at [Eli Tea Bar](https://www.eliteabar.com/pages/chicago) in Chicago.  The idea was to give a presentation, maximum seven minutes in length, on some niche topic.  My topic was on a logical fallacy, the fallacy of bifurcation, and connecting it to my recent interests in computer science and economics.  Bonus: I tie in a shout-out to the model of a [participatory economy](https://participatoryeconomy.org) and to the newly-formed [INDEP network](https://www.indep.network/).

I recorded video the presentation which is available at the top of this page as an embedded YouTube link.  The Microsoft PowerPoint file I used for the presentation is [available here](http://www.szcz.org/img/eli_2024-09-04.pptx).  Please enjoy.
