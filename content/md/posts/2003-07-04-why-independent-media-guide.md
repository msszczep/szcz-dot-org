_This was published as the afterward in the 2003 Chicago Indepdendent Media Guide._

I got involved in independent media by accident. I happened to watch my
hometown's public access channel one evening and I found the premiere episode
of a news magazine series called "Days Of Our Lies" (not "Lives"). The very
first feature story which aired on DOOL di scussed the increasing
concentration of media ownership and how it affected news content.

The show resonated with me; that story resonated with me. How come I had never
heard of this before? Where had this been all of my life? I later learned
that if people knew about things like corporate influence of the news, they
might not like those things and work t o do something about it. That's the
power wielded by independent media--media which isn't beholden to for-profit
interests, and which, I think, is one reason why such media is vital to
popular struggles and to the future of society.

Many are the stories of people who, while channel surfing or websurfing or
browsing, happened to chance upon that TV show or radio show or magazine or
book or website that gets them involved in improving the world. But the dice
are currently loaded in favor of finding for-profit mammoth media interests
which do the exact opposite. This, I think, is the primary motivation for
independent media and for this guide to Chicago's independent media: to
improve the odds, for producers of these outlets, for users of these outlets,
for all of us.
