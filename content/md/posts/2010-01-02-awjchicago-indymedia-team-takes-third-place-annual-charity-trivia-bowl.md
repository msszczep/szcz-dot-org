Members of Chicago Indymedia teamed up with the Chicago chapter of the
Association for Women Journalists (AWJ) to participate in the 2009 Trivia
Bowl, a charity fundraiser organized by the Asian American Journalists
Association - Chicago chapter (AAJA). The AWJ/Chicago Indymedia Superteam, as
it was called, finished in third place among 18 teams of journalists from a
number of corporate and non-profit media outlets.
  
The event, held at Haray Caray's Restaurant in downtown Chicago on November 8,
2009, was an annual fundraiser for AAJA-sponsored scholarships, and featured
five rounds of questions on Sports, In The News, Chicago and Illinois,
Entertainment and Pop Culture, and a picture round, asked to participating
teams.  
  
The AWJ/Chicago Indymedia superteam was tied for the lead in the first two
rounds of the event, finishing in third place behind the Chicago Tribune's
team which finished first, and teams from CBS 2 Chicago and the Chicago Sun-Times, which finished tied for second. The top team receives a travelling
trophy for one year and individual trophies for team participants.
  
Other media outlets that sent teams included Crain's Chicago Business, FOX
Chicago (which sent two teams), Bloomberg News, the Chicago Daily Herald, ABC
7 Chicago, the Chicago Maroon, and the Chicago Reporter.
  
Some of the corporate journalists attending the event didn't know about
Chicago Indymedia. One of the team members of CBS 2 Chicago, seeing Chicago
Indymedia at top of the team leaderboard after one round, was overheard asking
about Chicago Indymedia: "Who are they? A bunch of bloggers?"  
  
The AAJA Chicago website has the full list of participating teams, round-by-round scores, transcripts of the game play questions, and photos of the event,
along with archived results from past AAJA Trivia Bowls since the event's
debut in 2006:
