On October 26, 2023, the Journal of Information Economics [published a paper I wrote](https://www.anserpress.org/journal/jie/1/3/15) titled "Pseudocode and Algorithms for Computer Simulations of Democratically Planned Economies".  The paper outlines, in reasonably specific detail, the pseudocode for the computer code I helped write [to research the feasibility](https://www.routledge.com/Democratic-Economic-Planning/Hahnel/p/book/9781032003320) of a non-market, non-command-planning, democratic economy.

I am grateful to the Journal of Information Economics for accepting my paper.  I also present here, with different formatting and a couple of small updates, [the original submitted paper in PDF format](http://www.szcz.org/img/jie-paper-2023.pdf).
