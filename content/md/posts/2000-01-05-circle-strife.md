Georges Melies was a French film director. He was one of the premier innovators of the cinema in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But he
began his life working for his father making shoes.

Georges would become a magician. He bought a theater--the Theatre Robert-Houdin--where he produced magic shows. In 1895, Georges was one of 33 people
invted for the first public showing of the Lumiere Cinematograph, one of the
first moving pictures.

Georges was inspired. He made his own camera--the Kinetograph--and began
making his own films. He put magic tricks in his films; one film, The
Vanishing Lady, shows a woman sitting down, covered by a giant cloth, then
when the cloth is removed, the woman has turned into a skeleton.

More films followed. In 1896, Georges made a film called The Devil's Castle,
the first vampire movie ever made. In 1902, Georges made one of the most
famous achievements in early cinema--a 14-minute film called _A Trip to the Moon_, in which six people ride a cannon shell to the moon. The images from A
Trip to the Moon eventually inspired a music video made by the Smashing
Pumpkins, _Tonight, Tonight_.

But the film industry was changing, becoming bigger, more technical, and more
capitalistic. Georges could not keep up, and in 1923 went bankrupt. He would
still work in the film industry as a consultant to film historians and
sometime movie star, but he never again made another film. 

_(takes one giant step 60 degrees to the right, arriving back at the shoes)_

In a 16-year career, Georges made some 500 films totalling about 26 hours of
screentime. Only about 90 of these films survive today, some only one frame
long. That's mainly because the French Army, in 1917, seized some of Melies'
property where some 400 of his films were kept. Those films were melted down,
where they were made into a chemical for making _(picks up the shoes)_ the
heels of shoes.
