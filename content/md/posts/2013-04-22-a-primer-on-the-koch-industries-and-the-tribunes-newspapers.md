{:title "A primer on the Koch industries and the Tribune's newspapers"

The New York Times reported on Sunday, April 20th, that Koch Industries, run
by the infamous Koch brothers -- they of oil and global warming infamy -- is
considered the frontrunner in the race to buy the Tribune corporation's
newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times.
  
Understandably, [revulsion is widespread over the very prospect](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2013/04/21/1899241/koch-brothers-newspapers/), but many folks apparently need to be updated on a few things.  
  
For one, the very fact that the Tribune is being broken up, and that this sale
is even happening, is the consequence of grassroots political activism going
back at least a decade. The Tribune corporation, in 2002 and 2003, sought to
become a first-tier media corporation, like Time Warner, or NewsCorp, or
Viacom, and the plan was for the Tribune to expand via expanding its suite of
profitable and influential cross-media ownership holdings -- like owning TV
stations _and_ newspapers in New York and Los Angeles and Chicago. But instead
of owning them in a handful of cities, the vision was to own them in _every_
city in America. The FCC, then led by the infamous Michael Powell (who's now
[America's chief cable TV lobbyist](http://www.ncta.com/who-we-are/leadership/bio/169)), was only too happy to oblige. But grassroots
activists rallied Americans to what was happening just in time, and the
resulting outcry galvanized a court challenge which overturned the FCC's
attempt to overwrite those media ownership rules. (A second attempt in 2007 to
rewrite those rules failed a second time in court.)
  
The Tribune corporation, whiny over its loss, [moaned about the turn of events on its editorial pages](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org/news.php?id=152), and filed appeals to overturn the ruling. [Those appeals failed](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org/news.php?id=292), and when
Tribune shareholders saw that the Tribune had no Plan B for carrying out this
planned expansion, staged a revolt to demand an ownership change. They got it,
in the form of Chicago-area real estate billionaire mogul Sam Zell, who then
proceeded to make a bad situation far worse. Instead of charting a trajectory
of growth, Zell led [the Tribune into bankruptcy for four years](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org/news.php?id=617), [fending off well-heeled creditors](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org/news.php?id=689) who made hell for Zell.  
  
In early 2013 the Tribune emerged out from bankruptcy, but all reports say
that the commutation is actually a death sentence, [as Tribune plans to sell off most if not all of its media properties](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org/news.php?id=700). (It has
already sold off the Chicago Cubs baseball team, which it owned since the
1980s.) First on the chopping block: the newspaper holdings.
  
It's an irony that grassroots political activism played a key role in what
could be a buyout of a major American newspaper chain by two of America's most
reviled billionaires. If the opposition were smart they would exploit this
fact to discredit America's media reform and justice movements. Nevertheless,
the efforts to block the immediate media ownership rules at the FCC, while
successful, haven't (yet) addressed deeper concerns regarding undue political
influence, and corporate involvement in media and politics. [I've been working on this myself](http://www.szcz.org/); [no doubt others will as well](http://www.iopsociety.org). But suffice it to say that the Koch
buyout of the Tribune newspapers isn't a foregone conclusion for a number of
reasons.
  
For one, the Kochs will now get the full-throated response of the
environmental movement in addition to the media reform and media justice
communities in its attempted buyout. That's not insignificant; the
environmental movement has [increasingly been flexing its muscle on the climate crisis](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-fossil-fuel-resistance-20130411). Suddenly, once they hear that the Kochs may look to
widen their influence by buying out a number of prominent newspapers, they
will add their voices to the resistance. And it's been the growth of voices of
resistance which proved critical in blocking previous attempts at widening
media concentration.

For another, the FCC (the government agency which would have to approve a
transfer) is in a state of flux. They are short of their full complement of
five commissioners, with Republican Robert McDowell departing and chair Julius
Genachowski about to depart. The FCC might be leery to proceed on this without
a full complement of commissioners, though its unclear how long it would be
before it got back to full strength. Remember, the last two times the FCC
tried to proceed on increasing media ownership concentration, the FCC got
their rewrites smacked down in court. It might not bode well to go down that
rabbit hole again for a third consecutive time. Even so, the FCC might still
grant a one-time waiver or waivers for a transfer without having to enact a
full and thorny media ownership rewrite. But even _that_ might not work: the
FCC actually granted an exception to the Tribune itself in 2007, and that
action did nothing to prevent its current travails.
  
What's more, the Tribune could choose a less-notorious (or less-well-known)
company to buy out its newspapers. Sure, the Kochs are currently the leading
candidate, but it might not _stay_ the leading candidate. A deal could get
scuttled in ways we can't yet foresee, but which grassroots political activism
could foment. What's more, investors might be less than enthused to see Koch
get into an industry that's seen in many corners [as moribund](http://paidcontent.org/2013/04/11/two-charts-that-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of-newspapers/) and [steadily decreasing as a source of news and journalism](http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/internet-now-main-source-of-news-for-young-adults/), but
which [remains a prominent source of local community information](http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/local_news).  
  
Meanwhile, the [effects of global warming will escalate](http://www.edf.org/climate/climate-change-impacts), the
conservative media establishment [will continue to look like a bunch of headless chickens](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/04/19/boston-and-the-right-wing-medias-collapse/193703), and [to quote one friend](https://www.facebook.com/salim.muwakkil/posts/10152802160315601): "a new, right wing maneuver to capture the corporate media will make its biases even less implicit." The endgame is far from assured.  
  
Stay tuned...
