Four days in Boston of parties, media reform activism, networking, and [baby](http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150151202708019&comments) [chasing](http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150151198363019&comments) amidst the [5th National Conference for Media Reform](http://conference.freepress.net) left us tired and hungry on the afternoon of Sunday, April 10th, still with a day to spare before we would
leave town.  
  
The problem was, we were at the Boston waterfront, which is renowned for its
affinity for fish (I suspect being so close to the ocean may have something to
do with that), and I, having been vegan since September 1993, didn't expect to
find anything (or much of anything) to eat. Worse, the nearest non-hotel
restaurant we could find within ready walking distance was a sports bar, which
made me even more leery of finding anything to eat, never mind anything worth
writing a blog post about.  
  
Suffice it to say, I was very happy to be proved wrong. The restaurant we
found and ate at, [Jerry Remy's at the Boston Seaport](http://www.jerryremysseaport.com/), had the best veggie burger
in my entire life. For one, the sandwich was big, stunningly so (I like big
portions). The menu (online [in PDF](http://www.jerryremysseaport.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GSK_vJqX2XU%3d&tabid=615&language=en-US) and [in Scribd!](http://www.jerryremysseaport.com/Food/Menu/tabid/615/language/en-US/Default.aspx)) boasts it as "house-made organic", and it comprised a
delectable combination of grains, vegetables, and legumes -- even full cloves
of garlic. Score! And it being a sports bar on a Sunday afternoon, they had
lots of sports to watch; I was pleased to see games involving the Tigers and
Red Wings on TV at the time. Score!  
  
I asked to speak with the manager, a gentleman with the last name Mitchell
(grin), and informed him that I would write up a post of praise on my blog.
Mr. Mitchell kindly told me a little bit of the behind-the-scenes regarding
the restaurant, which accounts for _why_ the burger was so good.  
  
When in Boston, visit [Jerry Remy's Seaport](http://www.jerryremysseaport.com/) (not to be confused by [Jerry Remy's across from Fenway Park](http://www.jerryremys.com/index.html)).
