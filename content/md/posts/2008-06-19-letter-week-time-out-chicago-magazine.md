As someone involved in the Chicago political activist community, I appreciated
seeing the "Building a better protest" cover on the May 15-21 issue of Time
Out Chicago. I'm glad to see that political activism in Chicago gets some
positive coverage in a town whose corporate media tend to dismiss or downplay
grassroots political activism.  
  
However, I felt that Time Out Chicago should have given more local focus in
its selection of local activst groups. Not to take anything away from the
Chicago-area chapters of PETA or Greenpeace or A.N.S.W.E.R., but those are
groups with local chapters all over America. In a magazine that's supposed to
be about Chicago, I think that Time Out Chicago should have highlighted more
of the uniquely Chicago-based political activist groups that are doing good
work and deserve wider awareness.
