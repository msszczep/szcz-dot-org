For months, citizens have anticipated a rewrite of the Illinois
Telecommunications Act, the major state law in Illinois concerning the
internet and telecommunications technologies like telephone and cable
television.  
  
On Thursday, March 3, 2005, a new rewrite of the Illinois Telecommunications
Act was indeed introduced before the Illinois General Assembly. But the
proposed rewrite has caused much concern among community organizers.  
  
"It creates massive public subsidies for incumbent telecom
companies...and...guts the last vestiges of public service and protections
against price gouging," said Sascha Meinrath, an organizer on
telecommunications issues and a policy analyst with the non-partisan media
policy group Free Press.  
  
The bill in question, Senate Bill 1700, includes a number of proposed pro-
telecom-industry changes. These include striking out language assuring "just
and reasonable" charges by telecommunications carriers, as well as strikeouts
of public interest protections and assurances to "reasonable and timely
development of effective competition in all telecommunications service
markets."  
  
The bill has already galvanized opposition. Citizens Utility Board, a consumer
protection lobby working on Illinois utilities, has already assembled an
online action website
([cubaction.org/alertlist.asp](http://cubaction.org/alertlist.asp)) for
Illinois citizens to fax and email their elected officials quickly.  
  
A forum about communities and broadband internet in Peoria which plans to
convene on March 10 includes participants of a statewide citizens' coalition
group known as Get Illinois Online.  
  
Plans are also afoot to organize other forums across Illinois about the
telecom act. But such forums would have to be organized quickly, as the
rewrite would have to be completed by the anticipated end of the Illinois
General Assembly in May 2005.  
  
"The only good thing I can say [about the rewrite] is that it doesn't appear
to make muni networks illegal," Meinrath remarked on the emailing list of Get
Illinois Online, referring to local and municipal efforts by Illinois
communities to establish their own internet infrastructure.  
  
The Chicago City Council is galvanizing efforts to approve city-wide efforts
in Chicago, after a city Finance Committee hearing on the issue approved
efforts to study the matter.  
  
A number of organizers feared that the Telecom rewrite would squelch efforts
for such community internet efforts outright, including those already underway
in Chicago's North Lawndale neighborhood and in Champaign-Urbana as part of a
nascent community wireless network.  
  
One bill, Senate Bill 499, which would have done just that, has been pulled
from consideration for the time being.  
  
The senator who introduced the proposed telecom rewrite is Democrat James F.
Clayborne, Jr, the Majority Caucus Whip.  
  
According to an online database assembled by The Institute on Money in State
Politics, a nonpartisan state campaign finance research organization, Clayborne has received campaign contributions from a number of
major telecommunications interests.  
  
Clayborne's contributors include SBC, which contributed $4,000; AT&T, which is in merger proceedings with SBC and which contributed $7,000; and the Cable Television and Communications Association of Illinois, an industry group representing Illinois cable companies, which contributed $5,000.
