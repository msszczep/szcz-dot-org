{:title "My academic quiz competitions career"

One of my main hobbies for the past four years has been what has been called
academic quiz competitions. I have been most fortunate to be a part of two of
the premier programs in the world at the University of Michigan and the
University of Chicago. I have been blessed with a great deal of success in my
career, earning all star commendations at least five times, and gaining
national renown for my question writing prowess. I have also codified my
philosophy to writing questions in [the SZCZicago Manual of Style](http://lpd.uchicago.edu/users/msszczep/smos.html), my guide to
writing academic quiz competition questions.  
  
Here is the list of intercollegiate tournaments that I have participated in as
a player: the tournament (name and year), the team I played on, any additional
roles for my team (editor, captain, question writer, etc.), and any all star
commendations I've earned.
