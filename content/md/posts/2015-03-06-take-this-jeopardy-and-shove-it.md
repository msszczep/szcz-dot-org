At this writing the next online qualifier for the TV game show Jeopardy! is
[scheduled to open March 30, 2015](https://www.facebook.com/Jeopardy/photos/a.187939387923652.66723.101839449866980/885514418166142/?type=1&theater).  And while I really, really hope and want to be a contestant on that show, I'm
seriously considering skipping the qualifier.  
  
There's no doubt I can pass the test. I can pass nearly any knowledge test
that these TV shows throw my way; I've passed the Jeopardy! test time and time
again when I took it in person. That's not the problem. The problem is the
next step: getting chosen to be on the show. And that seems to me to be an
insurmountable obstacle, about which more below.  
  
There's something to be said about persistence. Bob Harris, in his books
["Steal This Book (and get life without parole)"](http://www.commoncouragepress.com/index.cfm?action=book&bookid=170\") and ["Prisoner of Trebekistan"](http://www.randomhouse.com/book/75636/prisoner-of-trebekistan-by-bob-harris) recounts that he got on the show after his fifth
try (and apparently the only time he actually passed the test). [One person I know](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=8194) who got on the show and became a nine-time champion got on after his eighth try.  
  
But this appears to be an anomaly. From what I can gather, if it takes you
that many tries to try out and _not_ get on the show, you're probably never
going to get on. I had a rare opportunity to confirm this -- perhaps rarer
than if I _had_ gotten on the show -- at the 2014 [Trivia Championships of North America](http://www.tcona.com/) in Las Vegas. I had the good
fortune during one of the rare "down times" to sit at a table with a number
of former Jeopardy! champions. I asked each of them how many times it took for
them to get on the show. I heard a lot of "ones", some "twos", a
"three"; I'd peg the average at a bit less than two.  
  
In fact, [I got on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxt-wHbD640) the
syndicated version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire after just my second try.
But now, I am a veteran of _seven_ in-person Jeopardy! tryouts; if I pass the
test in 2015 and go to yet another in-person tryout, that would mark my
eighth.  
  
But at this point, I'm resigned to think, if I didn't get on by now, they'll
never ever ever want me. That hasn't stopped some folks from trying over and
over. As Bob Harris put it in "Steal This Book" of some wannabe Jeopardy!
contestants, "stalkers give up more easily." Indeed, there are stories in
[the literature](http://www.ken-jennings.com/brainiac) and [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TCONA/permalink/537986716237031/) of wannabe contestants who have tried out as many as _fifteen_ times to no avail.  
  
Don't get me wrong; I love watching and playing along with the show. Always
have, always will. And there's certainly something to be said about
persistence and failure as a critical component for success in life. But at
the same time, there's also something to be said about knowing when to pack up
and move on.  
  
This was most evident in my most recent tryout. You'll forgive me if I don't
go into specifics here, but I got the feeling, reading between the lines, that
I was being given the cold shoulder. Upon reflection, I recognized the cold
shoulder in my past tryouts but still hoped that if I kept trying eventually I
would break through.  
  
Why won't they have me on the show? Lord only knows. Any or all of the
following reasons may apply:  
  
* My last name is "weird" and hard to pronounce  
* They've had enough educated, white, males who work at an empowering job (software developer in my case)  
* I'm too much of a veteran of the quizbowl community and want to limit the number of "ringers"  
* They don't want to risk a discussion of media policy and media activism, or even a hint of the issue being raised  
* They think I'm too hyper for a staid show like Jeopardy!  
* My stories are too long to fit in the 20 seconds that now seem to be alotted to on-air contestant "interviews"   
  
More likely, the actual reason I haven't gotten chosen to be on the show are
probably more dumb than I can possibly imagine. Ironic for a show that prides
itself on being smart.  
  
So fine. I guess I can't get on Jeopardy! no matter how hard I try. I could
rage against the machine, but I'd rather spend that energy to [improve the world](http://www.chicagomediaaction.org) and [write blog posts](http://www.szcz.org) and [write books](http://www.amazon.com/Bringing-Us-Tiers-Neutrality-Lectures-ebook/dp/B00LK09SCK/) and learn languages and make my millions in software
instead of taking my chances at a game show at which I merely have a one-in-
three chance to win.  
  
Besides, if I become famous, maybe someday I might get on [Celebrity Jeopardy](http://j-archive.com/search.php?search=celebrity+jeopardy&submit=Search)! ;-)
