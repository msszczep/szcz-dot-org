Do you think that in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues in Geneva
first wrote the Hypertext Transfer Protocol that would eventually become the
World Wide Web, or in 1969 when one research team at UCLA tried to send to
another team at Stanford the very first email message, do you think they were
thinking:

**"Maybe someday _everyone_ will have cyberporn, and vicious worms, and spam, and overvalued dot coms, and Really Big Buttons That Don't Do Anything."**

Do you think that in the late 19th and early 20th-centuries, when Paul Nipkow,
J. L. Baird, and Vladimir Zworykin worked with image scanning disks and neon
gas-discharge lamps to create and refine the technology of broadcasting moving
pictures, do you think they were thinking:

**"Maybe someday _everyone_ will be able to see Smackdown and South Park and Full House and Alf and Boston Common and Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionnaire and Studs."**

Do you think that in the mid 19th century, when Guglielmo Marconi worked to
extend Heinrich Hertz's parabolic mirror experiments in experiments to detect
electromagnetic waves across space, eventually leading to the advent of radio,
do you think he was thinking:

**"Maybe someday _everyone_ will be able to hear Dr. Laura and Stern and Imus and Rush and Liddy and morning zoos?"**

Do you think when Alexander Graham Bell was racing against Elisha Gray to
refine the harmonic telegraph into what would eventually become the telephone,
do you think they were thinking:

**"Maybe someday _everyone_ will have phone sex and be bugged by telemarketers and slamming and the Jerky Boys and..."**

Do you think that if we were to think a little bit more about what these
scientists and engineers, full of dreams of using their inventions for
improving the human condition and raising the cultural level of the world,
even just a little--do you think that we could improve the human condition and
raise the cultural level of the world, even just a little?

Do you think?
