{:title "My experience at the 2012 Team Trivia National Championship, and how we came _this close_ to winning $10,000"

From May 2012 through August 2012, my family and I had earned, through a
number of solid performances (including a number of wins) playing [Team Trivia](http://www.teamtrivia-il.com), a berth in the 2012 Team Trivia
National Championship, held on the afternoon of August 18, 2012, with a top
prize of $10,000. We could include up to six people in our team, and did we
ever: we had a _strong_ team, one with a chance to take the championship, but
having played in games like this my whole life, I knew that _you never know_.  
  
Teams were told at the outset that, with a prize pool of more than $21,000 at
stake, the questions would be harder than usual. Great, I thought (seriously).
I like hard questions, as would my teammates, and that would hopefully improve
our chances to win.  
  
Our team ("Pops and Mommers") assembled at [Burke's Public House](http://burkespublichouse.com/) on Broadway, just before the start
of the match. In the first half, we didn't fare very well -- we only got three
of the first nine questions in the first half correct, though we were "in the
ballpark" on three other questions (Steve Kerr, Ronald Reagan, Mad Men's
maypole) but our point wagering was sensibly maxed for the questions we knew
and we finished with 15 points. Our saving grace in the first half was that we
nearly swept the halftime question on famous bands' first #1 hits (getting 4
out of 5 possible for 8 points total) and we nearly swept a bonus first-half
question on celebrities' real names (getting 14 points out of 15 possible, the
most of any team, only missing Chris Angel). Despite our lackluster first
half, we fared far better than I thought or hoped: The top score nationally at
the time was 38 points, our halftime score was 35 points, first place in
Chicago and third place _in the country_.  
  
Then the second half, where the point values were doubled. There we fared
better -- we got five of nine second-half questions correct (Angus, Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing, the World Wildlife Fund, "silent", and Oingo
Boingo). We had a respectful performance in the second-half bonus question on
countries with the world's tallest mountains which included a gotcha that
wrong answered would have point values deducted (we responded with six
answers, getting five right and one wrong, net plus-eight points). However, we
were beside ourselves when in the category Games, we responded with "20"
rather than the correct "24" to the question "How many points are on a
backgammon board?", losing the chance to earn another six points.  
  
Even so, we were able to build our point total to 65 points, putting us both
first in Chicago and first _in the whole country_, with a four point over the
second-place team. Hot diggity -- if we can get the final question correct and
wager enough, we would win the national championship and $10,000. But if we
were wrong, we would lose whatever we would wager.  
  
When I surveyed the list of questions thus far, I noted aloud "You know,
there hasn't been a movie question yet." The final question was: "Name two
of the five movies which were nominated for all of the following: the 2012
Academy Award for Best Picture, the 2012 Golden Globe for Best Picture, and
the 2012 [Critics Choice](http://www.criticschoice.com/) Movie Award for
Drama".  
  
In short order, we were able to figure out a number of contending films: The
Artist, The Help, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The Descendants, Hugo,
Moneyball, Warhorse. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was out. The Artist,
which swept the Oscars but which was a comedy, was out. The Descendants was in
-- nominated for a lot, critically acclaimed, and a drama. So of the remaining
films, which should we pick. At that point, we heard:  
  
"The Tree of Life?"  
  
This resonated with us. Terence Malick routinely gets nominated for awards,
and his movie even won the freaking Palme d'Or at Cannes. Plus, time was
running out -- we had to make a choice and so we did: The Arist, and The Tree
of Life, for 17 points (which we determined to give us an unreachable 82
points and the championship).  
  
Shortly after we had submitted our final answer, the list of correct films was
announced:  
  
Moneyball  
Warhorse  
The Descendants  
The Help  
Hugo  
  
Ouch. Heartbreaking. Not only did we miss the correct answer, we chose the
_only incorrect answer in a set where **any other answer we could have chosen** would have been correct_. Instead of 82 points, a national championship, and $10,000, we finished with 48 points and fourth place in
Chicago, resulting in a $75 gift certificate to Burke's Public House which we
spent that day on a lot of food. We walked home, morose, shocked, vowing to
come back next year. Why not? After all, we showed we could compete and come
as close as anyone could to winning the championship without actually winning
the championship.
