{:title "This used to be my ACFWeb page, but..."

something happened one day. I'm not exactly sure what. Apparently, the file
that had my collection of ACFWeb links got corrupted one day. The HTML just
stopped in mid-file. As a result, the page ended, and I wasn't terribly astute
in making a backup for that page (a lesson learned the hard way).

However, there may still be people who would expect the ACFWeb to be present.
I would offer my apologies to the three or four of you out there. It's just
that I don't have the heart to restart the web page--I'd rather work on
learning. Moreover, there's a much cooler webpage maintained by [Dwight Kidder](http://users.sgi.net/~kidder/refdesk/refs.htm) that has a **LOT**
of informative and interesting links, so there's no real vacuum that needs to
be filled. To be sure, I could make such a page of my own, but see above.

Thanks for understanding.
