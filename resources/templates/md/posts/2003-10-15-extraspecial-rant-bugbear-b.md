{:title "An Extra-Special Rant About Bugbear B"

Roger Ebert wrote a now-famous review of the movie "North" which began: "I
hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated,
hated this movie."

I felt the same way on June 5, 2003 -- not about a movie but about a malevolent
computer worm which warranted three separate email alerts on that day and the
next. The worm is called Bugbear B, and I hate this worm. Hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate this worm.

I hate this worm because it took up nearly two-thirds of my time on June 5 in
computer "cleaning" and damage control activities, and Bugbear B continues
to drain (much less) time away from work. On June 5, I received God-knows-how
many copies of this worm in the more than 30 email lists I maintain as part of
my job. And that's saying something given that I'm typically a lightning rod
for all kinds of interesting viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

Bugbear B wasn't even 3 days old when it made its infamous debut on June 5,
prompting headlines that very day on Reuters and in the Washington Post. The
worm is the sequel to a worm called Bugbear (hence the "B") which made its
first appearance in October 2002. But Bugbear B is without a doubt the most
vicious computer worm I have ever seen in my entire life. Bugbear B:

(1) Sends emails with highly plausible text (stolen from email accounts that
the worm previously attacked)  
(2) Varies the "From" field, and invents the sending address from out of
thin air.  
(3) Varies the "Subject" field (at least 25 variations have been found to
date, and invents new subject fields)  
(4) Includes an attachment (which propagates the worm), invents the name of
the attachment from out of thin air.  
(5) Has successfully fought back against antivirus software.  

And all in a payload just 72 kilobytes big.

Fortunately, the Bugbear B plague has died down somewhat, but at this writing,
I suspect (but don't know if) the bastard or bastards who wrote Bugbear B
is/are still at large. If so, they may cooking up more evil surprises.

I have to admit, that there's a feeling of awe to this entire episode. As much
as I loathe and revile Bugbear B, I can't help but admire the tenacity behind
this worm, regardless who built it and their level of computer expertise.
(I'll bet that it was someone in high school or college without much
expertise.) I must say that my admiration for Bugbear B is a heavily tempered
sort of admiration, like watching a nuclear bomb explosion on TV and saying to
yourself "Ooh, look at all the pretty colors."

Needless to say, if you get a suspicious email with an attachment from someone
you don't know, be sure to alert your local systems administrator. Thank you.
