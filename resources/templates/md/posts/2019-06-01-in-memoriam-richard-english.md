It was late summer 1983, probably August, definitely a week before I was about to start
third grade.  My mother was driving my sister and I when we passed by North East
Complex, where my godmother worked.  My mother stopped the car so we could pay a visit to my 
godmother.  I objected.

"NOOOOOO!!!!!"

We went anyway.  I don't remember why I objected.  Probably because I thought that 
visits to my godmother were interminably long and _boring_.  I thought that this would be no 
different.  I could not be more wrong. 

In the course of the visit, my godmother asked me if he could introduce me to Mr. English,
one of her colleagues.  I agreed.  

It should be noted that at this time in my life, I was _mad_ about weather -- meteorology, 
weather forecasts, weather maps.  I read books on the topic.  I had books on the topic.
I always, _always_ looked forward to the weather report on the local TV news.  Unsurprisingly,
I wanted to be a weatherman when I grew up.

I met Mr. English, and I was duly impressed that on the walls of his office, Mr. English 
had printouts of _satellite weather maps_.  Cool guy.

Even cooler: Mr. English told me that he worked on a radio station and asked me if I would
provide weather reports on Saturdays on the station.  Heck, yeah.

I very quickly regretted my objection, and I was glad that my mother gave in to whatever 
urge she had to pay a visit to my godmother.  I don't think I would have met Mr. English 
otherwise.

Indeed, on Saturday later that same week, my first broadcast was scheduled at 11:05AM and 
I read from the Grand Rapids Press that day's weather report, forecast, and some weather 
statistics.  I would continue in this vein for some months until I got a weatheradio.  
Then we transcribed my weather report from the continuous weather broadcasts from Kent County 
International Airport.

My broadcast schedule expanded so that I later delivered weather reports at 10:00AM in 
addition to 11:05.  One day, after one of my weather reports, I stayed on when I decided to 
regale Mr. English with another interest of mine -- trivia questions.  I had written about 
ten or so questions, and read them on the air with Mr. English as my unwillling accomplice.  
I remember one of the questions I asked was, "What does FDR stand for?"

Mr. English to his credit encouraged this, and it became a regular feature.  Twice on Saturdays
I would report the weather _and_ follow it up with some significa: a brief question and 
accompanying answer (what we called a "fact") or a longer narrative about some interesting
phenomena (what we called a "story") which I found and read on the air from my book collection.
My broadcast schedule expanded further so that I also delivered a report and factoid 
in the afternoon, at 4:15PM.

So it continued, more or less, every Saturday, for nearly six-and-a-half years.  
In all that time, I never once visited the station in person.  I don't think I ever
even learned the station's address.  I did attend a station meeting once, held at North East
Complex.

I remember the date of my last broadcast: December 24, 1989 -- the day before Christmas.
By now I was a freshman in high school.  And with a holiday break forthcoming I had a break
in broadcasting -- except that I never heard back from the station, nor from Mr. English, 
or as to why.

I finally found out what happened...fifteen years later.  By now I had moved to Chicago and
had earned my second master's degree.  I had also made an unpaid career of my own 
in media generally: producing a TV series, making short documentary films, building 
websites, working on media policy, and of course working in radio, maintaining one radio 
show and then another.  Among the resources in media I had contributed to, and
availed myself of, was GRTV.  One day, I heard from my mother that Mr. English was working
as staff at GRTV.

So one day, I visited GRTV and (re)introduced myself.  And it struck me: In all the times 
I had seen Mr. English while I was growing up, I had never before seen his 
_eyes_.  Every time I had seen him, Mr. English -- Richard -- wore sunglasses.  I didn't
even know what colors his eyes _were_.

We caught up, insofar as someone could catch up on fifteen years in a few minutes.  
I informed him that my godmother, who had introduced us to each other, had since passed 
on.  And he informed _me_ that two members of the radio station had conspired to seize 
control of the station's broadcast license, sell it, and split the resulting 
quarter-million-dollars between the two of them, much to the consternation of the 
rest of the station staff and to my own disgust a decade-and-a-half after the fact.

That impromptu catching-up meeting wound up being the last time Richard and I interacted
together in person.  I would see him now and again on GRTV interviewing various folks.
But I was surprised, and shocked, when I got an eVite in 2019 inviting me to attend 
Richard English's memorial service.  Even more, according to the graphic accompanying 
the eVite, Richard was born in 1934, which meant that he was nearly fifty when he gave 
me, a hyper overenthusiastic nine-year-old, a regular radio spot, which he continued to 
nurture over the next decade.

After nearly every radio segment of mine, he would remark back with something funny or 
insightful of his own.  I guess it's not until now that I realize that we had good 
chemistry, a rapport.  Mr. English -- Mr. _Richard_ English -- was a positive influence
in my upbringing, a positive example to follow, and someone whom I will dearly miss.
