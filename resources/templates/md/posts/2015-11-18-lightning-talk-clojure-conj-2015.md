I adapted my [presentation on The Parse is Right](http://www.szcz.org/posts/2015-10-14-video-parse-right-using-clojure-clojurescript-examine-english.html) as a Lightning Talk (a six-minute long presentation) at Clojure Conj 2015 (a major annual conference of Clojure developers).  

The video is [online here](https://youtu.be/zvocHR_gg1Y) for your viewing pleasure.  Unfortunately, ClojureTV disabled video embedding so I can't include an embed on this page.
