The Hollywood Reporter recently [released their list](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-movie-quotes-hollywoods-top-867142/item/i-couldve-been-a-contender-866849) of what they deemed to be the best movie quotes from the history of Hollywood.  Of course, the American Film Institute [also has its vaunted list](http://www.afi.com/100Years/quotes.aspx) of what it deems the greatest movie quotes of all time.   

But both lists omitted my personal favorite movie quote of all time.  It's easy to miss because it's a from movie little considered now (for good reason) -- the 1988 movie [License to Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095519/?ref_=nv_sr_1).  The movie has one, and _only_ one, redeeming facet -- [this quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZV8WZtXmL4&t=11m19s):

_Does Mommy hold your dicks when you piss?_

The quote justly earns low marks for its scatology, its childishness, its impropriety in most social settings, and more than a twinge of sexism.  Still, it's my personal favorite because I find it so eminently useful in so many circumstances.  It's certainly not the most polite thing to say out loud, but it's nothing that an [abbreviation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PEBCAK) [can't](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM) [fix](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/JFGI).  Therefore, I propose taking the initials of our quote to craft:

DMHYDWYP (pronounced "dim hid whip")

You may now commence using this for all appropriate circumstances.
