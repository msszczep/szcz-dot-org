More than 15 protesters took part in a rally at Tribune Plaza on September 4, 2003. The rally was organized to protest against the FCC deregulation vote of June 2, which saw a significant repeal of the remaining media ownership rules
in the United States. [Disclosure: The author of this article was also one of
the organizers of the rally.]

The rally proceeded in spite of an Philadelphia appeals court ruling on
September 3 granting a stay against the change of the media ownership rules,
which would have gone into effect on September 4.

The rally was sponsored by Chicago Media Action, the Chicago chapter of the
National Organization for Women, and the Independent Press Assocation -- Chicago. Representatives of each of the three sponsoring groups spoke at the rally: Mitchell Szczepanczyk and Karen Young, the president and treasurer
respectively of Chicago Media Action; Jackie Lalley, the Chicago Area
Coordinator of the Independent Press Association; and Jennifer Koehler, the
president of Chicago NOW.

Tribune Plaza was chosen as the rally venue because the Tribune Company has
been lobbying in favor of the deregulation. One of the FCC rules of particular
interest to the Tribune (and one under heated contention in Congress) is the
FCC's cross-ownership rule, which would allow a single firm to own a newspaper
and a TV station in the same market.

The rally was one of nearly a half-dozen similar events around the United
States organized in concert to condemn the FCC's ownership deregulation
efforts. One resource, [reclaimthefcc.org](http://www.reclaimthefcc.org),
noted similar rallies in San Francisco, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, and Los
Angeles. The efforts against the FCC (particularly a mention of the Chicago
rally) earned a prominent mention in Danny Schechter's News Dissector Weblog
for September 3 on [mediachannel.org](http://www.mediachannel.org).

CAN-TV was on hand to videotape the event. After the rally ended, a number of
rally participants moved to the NBC Tower, just east of the Tribune Tower, to
shoot some more photographs.
