{:title "My mega-ambitious dream: Build a parallel participatory economy online"

Let me share two quotes:  
  
Quote one: Larry Page, one of the co-founders of Google, once gave the
commencement address at his (and my) alma mater, the University of Michigan.
He said: "I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious
dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy
enough to do it, you have little competition."  
  
Quote two: PHP is a very common programming language that's used for
development on the web, but on which in recent years has been derided for its
many technical flaws. Even so, PHP remains staggeringly popular, being used by
such websites and platforms like Facebook, Wordpress, Drupal, and my very own
website. You would figure that a language that's widely derided for its flaws
wouldn't merit such wide use, but intertia is a powerful thing. In response,
one commenter offered this advice: "The best way to combat something as
pervasively and institutionally awful as PHP is not to point out all its
(many, many, many) faults, but to build compelling alternatives and make sure
these alternatives are equally pervasive, as easy to set up and use as
possible."  
  
I mention these two quotes because they are connected in one project I'm
thinking of building. Folks who follow my work know that I've long been an
advocate of the model of economics known as participatory economics (parecon).
But it hasn't been as tested in the here-and-now real world as much as I would
like (though it has been implemented; there's even a book, which I contributed
to, called "Real Utopia" about some of its implementations). If we want to
make progress against the existing economic order, we do more than just point
out the flaws of the existing economic order, we build a compelling
alternative. I think we _have_ a compelling alternative; now we need to work
on implementing it, or at the very least testing it in some wide fashion to
confirm that it's worth implementing more widely. But how?  
  
Here's where the mega-ambitious-dream part comes in: Let's build our own
worldwide participatory economy on the internet, for people to join in and
contribute. (This isn't a new idea; indeed, similar ideas can be found the
very first articulations of parecon, but technically speaking this is far more
feasible to implement now than ever before.) Say for the sake of argument that
we make a website to implement a participatory economy. A person can visit the
website, login to a secure, private account, and see (among other things) the
following:  
  
* A list of the tasks they have  
* A list of the tasks they can choose, or build new tasks if they so choose  
* A list of the jobs and work those tasks are a part of  
* The desirability ratings and empowerment ratings for those tasks, to ensure that they're balanced for desirability and empowerment  
* The effort scores and sacrifice scores for those tasks, to calculate payment  
* The payment penalties that are applied and automatically computed if the tasks are _not_ balanced for desirability and empowerment (providing an incentive to ensure jobs _are_ balanced for desirability and empowerment)  
* The credits earned for socially-valued labor  
* The consumption proposals relevant to one's current circumstances, with the ability to view other proposals at any scale  
* The indicative prices (and rationale for those prices) for goods and services in the economy  
* The connecting of one's work efforts in socially valued labor to fulfill needs in the participatory economy, completing the loop  
  
This might be closer to an endgame situation rather than an opening move --
what it looks like after the revolution rather than before it. But I think
that there won't _be_ a revolution _without_ providing an alternative that I
think will work, or if it won't work, learn why and build from that. After
all, "[l]earning is a feedback loop. You take an action, see the result,
learn a lesson. The smaller the loop, the less time from action to result: the
quicker you learn, the faster you advance."  
  
We could use this online participatory economy not just to connect folks who,
frankly, are already reasonably affluent, but to connect folks who aren't so
AND who can tap into a system like this. (Yes, I know that there's a digital
divide that blocks many people to online, but let me imagine this for the time
being.) People who have tangible needs on feeding the hungry, housing the
homeless, conserving resources, brought in contact with folks who can cook
food, provide shelter, build energy-efficient tools. Those who do the work
would be credited for the effort and sacrifice for their labor, and can use
the credits in the participatory economy as part of a participatory plan. Over
time and over a wide enough scale, we might just abolish markets,
corporations, capitalism -- by making them obsolete.  
  
So, that's my mega-ambitious dream. What do you think?
