Zachary Kauser Szczepanczyk was born on Sunday, March 7, 2010, at 6:47 AM
Central Time. He weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces at birth, and measured 20 inches
in length.  
  
Zachary's full name comes from three different languages: Hebrew for
"Zachary" (a variation of "Zachariah" which means "The Lord recalled"),
Urdu for "Kauser" (which means "intelligent" or "wise one"), and Polish
for "Szczepanczyk" ("son of Stephen [Szczepan]", even though this Zachary
is a son of Mitchell). :-)
