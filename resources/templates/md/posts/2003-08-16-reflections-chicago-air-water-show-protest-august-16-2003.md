{:title "Reflections on the Chicago Air and Water Show Protest: August 16, 2003"

My last visit to the Chicago Air and Water Show [took place two years ago](http://chicago.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=4079). It could have gone better: Pouring rain, only three visible protesters, and I found
myself unable to refute the argument that war helps create freedom of speech.

Not this year. Sunny skies (if trez hot). Dozens of protesters (one organizer
told me that some 50 or more protesters and supporters were present throughout
the day). And before I went to the protest, I studied up: I looked up the
Espionage Act of 1917, the Smith Act of 1940, and the USA Patriot Act, all of
which suggest that war doesn't create freedom of speech; on the contrary, each
of these measures to constrict freedom of speech were passed during times of
war (World War I, World War II, and the War on Terror/Afghanistan,
respectively).

I got to the North Avenue footbridge around 2pm. I turned myself into a living
billboard, themed to the media given its key role in our recent wars. I wore a
[Faux News T-Shirt](http://www.agitproperties.com/osc/eshop/product_info.php?products_id=1). To my back I had taped a poster of the radio show [This Is Hell](http://www.thisishell.net). And a bright orange poster with two
media related quotes. On one side: "The media: As liberal as the corporations
that own them." On the other side: "We're listening to the news. We'll let
you know if we find any."

This last quote puzzled one passerby who asked me, "We'll let you know if we
find any WHAT?"

I had heard in advance that Viacom-owned WBBM Chicago newsradio would be
broadcasting at the Show. I was hoping/envisioning that there would be a WBBM
booth and people would be passing by and I would stand right in front of it
(even if they wouldn't let me on the air) and try to embarrass WBBM with
flyers, the sign, and chants ("Shame on BBM! Shame on BBM!") until either I
got tired or until they called the police.

No dice. There was a booth, but access to it was guarded by two checkpoints. I
made my way through one checkpoint, and at the second point I was told the
WBBM booth is a private area (but they're using the public airwaves) and
access was restricted only to those whose names appeared on a list. Yeah,
whatever. Thanks a heap. I didn't waste their time, or my time, thereafter
with this.

So, back into the crowd. Generally positive vibes from those who actually
responded. ("Right on!" "You got that right!" "I like your shirt.") Only
one negative response comes to mind, with dialogue seemingly inspired by Pee
Wee's Playhouse.

> Random Woman [to me as I'm holding up my sign]: Loser.  
Me: Look who's talking.  
Random Woman: Idiot.  
Me: Chump.  

I'm happy to say that I was able to deflate the only halfway-reasoned argument
that came my way, which I entered midway through the argument.

> Random Man: Things have changed 9/11  
Me: Hey, that's what the terrorists said.  
Random Man: You're not that well educated.  
Me: Yeah, I must have imagined those two master's degrees.  

As I left the protest, I went to the portion of the North Avenue footbridge on
the west side of Lake Shore Drive. What I saw broke my heart. Litter, mostly
consisting of flyers passed out by the protesters on the other side of the
bridge.

Walking further: more waste, more heartbreak. A massive sound-stage-sized
display courtesy the U.S. Army, with its racist "Army Of One" campaign which
leads to litter of a vastly different sort. Our money, our soldiers. Since we
declared "Mission Accomplished" in Iraq, U.S. soldiers have been dying at a
rate of about two per day in an occupation some 9,000 miles away that's
costing U.S. taxpayers about a billion dollars a week.
