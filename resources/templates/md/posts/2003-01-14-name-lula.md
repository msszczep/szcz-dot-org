(sung to the song "Copacabana" by Barry Manilow)

His name was Lula, he was a lather.  
He sold candy, he made screws; his little finger he did lose.  
Making sheets of metal smoo-ooth.  
The sixth of seven kids; his older brother, dear forbid,  
Was arrested and beaten by the hand  
Of the military junta 'til he could not stand.  

'cause he's Lula, Luiz da Silva.  
More valued than gold, bronze and silver.  
'cause he's Lula, Luiz da Silva.  
His record's clean with a different kind of green.  
'cause he's Lula...what to do now?  

(His name is Lula...)  

In that same year, Lula did win.  
The presidential role that his union did extoll.  
He helped to form the Worker's Party.  
Three times he tried to run for president bar none.  
Lost all three: no bliss. But hey look at this!  
Fourth time's the charm! A win! Sealed with a kiss!  

'cause he's Lula (LU!), Luiz da Silva (LA!).  
More valued than gold, bronze and silver.  
'cause he's Lula (LU!), Luiz da Silva.  
His record's clean with a different kind of green.  
'cause he's Lula...Look at him now!  

(His name is Lula...)  

The markets tanked and the Real fell down.  
There's no money to be made to help the poor and not free trade.  
But I.M.F. SAPs all your money.  
They don't help make things more sane, save the planet, reduce pain.  
You can almost overhear: a better scheme is here!  
You can stick the FTAA In! Your! Ear!  

'cause he's Lula (LU!), Luiz da Silva (LA!).  
More valued than gold, bronze and silver.  
'cause he's Lula (LU!), Luiz da Silva.  
His record's clean with a different kind of green.  
'cause he's Lula...Watch him work now!
