About twenty people braved bitter winter cold to participate in a promotional
action on December 3, 2006, on a highway overpass to commemorate a political
activist who committed suicide to protest the war in Iraq.  
  
Members with the "I Heard You, Malachi" campaign organized the event held
near the intersection of Grand Avenue and Peoria Street overlooking southbound
lanes on Chicago's I-90/94 Expressway.  
  
The action was held near the Millennium Flame on Chicago's Kennedy Express on
the one-month anniversary of the death of Malachi Ritscher, a Chicago-based
musician and political activist who burned himself to death in protest of the
War in Iraq at the Millennium Flame.  
  
Ritscher's protest is reminiscent of immolation protests enacted against the
Vietnam War in the 1960s. Ritscher was accompanied with a protest sign reading
"Thou Shalt Not Kill" and a video camera. The contents of the video camera
have not been made public.  
  
Two banners -- a white banner reading "I Heard You Malachi", and another
green banner reading "Honk, honk if you want PEACE" -- were posted on
display for about two hours amid the sunny but tremendously cold conditions.
Nearby warming stations helped event participants endure wind chill
temperatures near zero degrees Fahrenheit.  
  
"We've had one demonstration. This is our second demonstration. We're
flyering. We're sending out emails. And the word has really spread", said
Jennnifer Diaz, an organizer with the "I Heard You, Malachi" campaign in an
interview with Chicago's CNN bureau at the demonstration.  
  
Media coverage in the corporate media of Ritscher's death and the issues it
raised was sparse at first. Traffic reports initially described the situation
as a traffic tie-up, then as a suicide, with no follow-up.  
  
After the story broke, coverage widened to an assortment of [local and national websites](http://www.iheardyoumalachi.org/links.html), mentions
in the Chicago Sun-Times by movie reviewer Richard Roeper, and a story about
the spare media coverage in the Chicago Reader.  
  
With the efforts surrounding the "I Heard You, Malachi" campaign, coverage
continued to widen and break further into the corporate sphere with an widely
republished Associated Press story and subsequent articles by the Chicago
Tribune. A segment about the December 3 demonstration aired on CNN's Anderson
Cooper 360.  
  
"When something like this [Malachi's suicide] can happen and people not find
out about it, I think there's something wrong with our media", said Diaz.
"They've got all kinds of reasons for why it wasn't covered -- [but] the fact
of the matter is, I think this is an important political act."  
  
"A man doused himself with gasoline and gave his life in protest of this war.
Other Americans need to know about that."
