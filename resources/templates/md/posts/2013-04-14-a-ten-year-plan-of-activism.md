{:title "A \"ten-year plan\" of activism"

Last year, I devised what I called a "ten-year plan" of activism for myself
to help build towards participatory economy. I'd like to share that plan here:  
  
Step One - Write a blog consistently to chronicle it all. (Status: Done!) :-)  
  
Step Two - Devise some database, or simulacrum, or role-playing game of sorts,
for a participatory economy. The idea is to show _to ourselves_ (that is,
parecon advocates) that the idea, frankly, is worth pursuing. If it's not, we
can drop the idea and look for something else. Plus, we can use this as a
testing grounds of sorts to show for various circumstances and find things we
didn't foresee or imagine. (Status; I'm currently working on it; I've got a
database schema drawn up and I'm presently building up the databases. I hope
to share a skeletal framework and a small example or examples in a few days.
I'll call for help to populate them, but one thing at a time...)  
  
Step Three - Devise _some_ kind of outright tangible economics playoff. There
are resources and pages, [like those on ZNet](http://www.zcommunications.org/zparecon/capvsparown.htm), that do
a comparison between on the one hand the unholy trinity of markets,
capitalism, and corporations, with parecon on the other hand. But if we can
somehow _show_ a comparison of sorts between the two, building on the testing
grounds idea in Step Two, I think we can convince more people. The playoff
could be done using the ideas of what's called agent-based computational
economics -- devising a simulated computer economy with the same "players"
playing different "games" (that is, one person or society in a participatory
economy, another in a market/corporate/capitalist hellscape), showing the
outcome and comparisons between the two, and using this as a teaching tool
(disguised perhaps [as some clever game](http://gamification.org/wiki/Gamification)).  
  
Step Four - Craft some kind of epic fictional story or novel set in a
participatory economy. (Rumor has it that one noted sci-fi author is
apparently doing something along these very lines; we'll hopefully see the
results soon.) This is harder than it looks, but if successful can have huge
payoffs. For one, a _good_ fictional envisioning would require some grounding
in the real word, and that would require research -- perhaps as much research
as writing a nonfiction work. Even so, an envisioning is bound to get things
wrong, embarrassingly so in some instances. The history of predictions [is littered with howlers](http://www.experts-speak.com/). ("It's very hard to predict things. Especially the future.") That's why I think we must test
the ideas we want to espouse _first_ and learn about problems or concerns with
them _first_ before putting them in a wider arena and getting our lessons back
in a more public and more painful manner. What's more, fiction can be a useful
vector. If we can disguise our ideas correctly, we can hopefully have a better
chance to smuggle them into the stories that can pass through corporate media
filters that would normally block such ideas outright. After all, [it worked for Star Trek](http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/wisdom/trek.html)...  
  
Step Five -- What I call "The Patton Maneuver": to convert an existing well-
known institution into a participatory framework. I cite here the idea brought
for by Eric Patton [in his essay "Winning"](http://www.szcz.org/article/476), where he suggests the
idea of converting an institution into a participatory example that can't be
ignored anymore by the dominant culture or for that matter even by opponents
of the dominant culture (who themselves sometimes have a vested stake in
current circumstances). I find the idea intriguing, but in order to build
towards it, we have to make such ideas thinkable, preferably pointing to
examples (even if fictional) that can spur such action and enable that hoped-
for "snowball effect".  
  
There is one thing about this plan that I'd like to mention. It doesn't entail
a whole lot of what might be typically construed as "activism"; no protests,
no marches, no signs, no dramatic arrests. It's a lot of writing, thinking,
and arguably some computer programming (the last of which I admit is due to a
personal bias of my own since my job is programming computers). But the goal
is progress, and we've seen that "typical" activism doesn't always work. Ten
years ago, on February 15, 2003, [the world staged the largest ever mass-protest against a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15,_2003_anti-war_protest) (the 2003 escalation of the War in Iraq) before
the war even formally launched, not to mention other marches, signs, arrests,
and so on -- but the war happened anyway. Sometimes, you need to take a step
back in order to take two steps forward, and that's what this "ten-year
plan" is all about.  
  
And for anyone reading this plan: Feel free to steal any parts of this plan.
