{:title "Powerpoint and PDF materials on participatory economics and women's economic equity "

In 2008 and 2009, I helped create materials for the Economic Equity team of
the [Chicago chapter of the National Organization for Women](http://www.chicagonow.org), where I explored the connections
between women's economic equity and the model of economics known as [participatory economics](http://www.parecon.org).  
  
I'm making available here copies of the files (one in Microsoft) that resulted
from that materials development. Please download and pass these around to
folks who you think may enjoy and find these materials worthwhile, and do let
me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
