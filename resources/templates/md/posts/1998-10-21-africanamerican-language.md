_"There are two ways of talking. One way if you **want** a job, and that other way."_  
--Chris Rock  
  
From October 1996 to June 1998, I was a graduate student in the [linguistics department](http://humanities.uchicago.edu/linguistics) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu). During part of my stay there, linguistics
got some coverage in the corporate media and gained a greater degree of
awareness in the public consciousness. (A great many interesting and poignant
articles came my way during this time as well--hence the reason for this
page.) The reason had to do with a [December 18, 1996 decision by the Oakland Unified School District](http://www.szcz.org/ousd.aae) (OUSD) in Oakland, California. The
district affirmed that the speech of inner-city African-Americans was
different from that of other variants of the language, which could impede the
education of inner-city African-American children. The OUSD chose to work
with, rather than against, this fact.  
  
Linguists who study this variant of English have referred to it as African-
American English, but it has known by many different names, including Black
English Vernacular (BEV), Vernacular Black English (VBE), African-American
Vernacular English (AAVE, pronounced "ave"), and -- the most commonly known
name -- Ebonics. The word "Ebonics" dates back to 1973, when psychologist
Robert Williams published a 1975 book on the topic --_Ebonics: The True Language of Black Folks_. The word itself is a portmanteau (a combination-word) of "ebony" and "phonics". ([University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu) linguist [John Lawler](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/ling/jlawler/index.html) called the name "ebonics" "surely the worst language name ever manufactured" in a [usenet posting](http:///www.szcz.org/lawler.aae))  
  
With equal parts confusion, ignorance, and misunderastanding, the corporate
media and American public would vilify this decision and the reasons for it.  [Cal-Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) linguist [Charles Fillmore](http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/lingdept/Handbook96-97/handbook6.html#FILLMORE) chronicled the vilification in an informative and
readable article, ["Semantics and the Ebonics Debate"](http://www.szcz.org/fillmore.aae).  
  
Just weeks after OUSD announced their decision, the [Linguistics Society of America](http://www.lsadc.org/) held its annual meeting (in Chicago, no less), in which
the LSA made public a [resolution](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/ling/jlawler/ebonics.lsa.html) supporting the OUSD Decision.
Another Chicago connection to the matter: the chair of the University of
Chicago, [Salikoko Mufwene](http://humanities.uchicago.edu/linguistics/faculty/mufwene.html), submitted an [op-ed](http://www.szcz.org/mufwene.aae) to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com), and co-edited a book on the topic (with
[John Rickford](http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~rickford/ebonics), Guy Bailey, and John Baugh): _African-American English: Structure, History, and Use_, available from [Routledge press](http://www.routledge.com). Another pertinent,
readable, and important book that talks about AAE (among other language variants) is _[English With an Accent](http://wally.english.wwu.edu/rlg/English-Accent.html)_, by a former professor of mine, [Rosina Lippi-Green](http://wally.english.wwu.edu/rlg/index.html).  
  
There is a vast body of scholarship spent on AAE; a [comprehensive bibliography](http://departments.colgate.edu/diw/SOAN244bibs.html) on the subject was compiled at [Colgate University](http://www.colgate.edu).  
  
(Final note to academic quiz competitors, including NAQT and CBCI: you *CANNOT* write a respectable tossup question on BEV using linguistic facts. To do so would invariably bring in facts that can refer to a host of other languages, and would lead to a misleading question. The best anyone can do is to write a question about *terms* like BEV or Ebonics, but bringing in linguistic facts into a question can be dangerous.)
