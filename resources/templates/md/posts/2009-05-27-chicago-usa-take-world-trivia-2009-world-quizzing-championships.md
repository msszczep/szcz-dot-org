When: Saturday, June 6th, from 12pm to 2:30pm CT  
Where: Sulzer Regional Library, 4455 N. Lincoln Avenue, Chicago  
What: The Chicago locale of the 2009 World Quizzing Championships  
  
On Saturday, June 6th 2009, game show contestants, trivia players, and other
know-it-alls will gather in Chicago and at locations in 10 states to test
their wits against others across the globe during the World Quizzing
Championships. The two-hour written test taken by individuals will cover
popular and academic trivia in the areas of culture, entertainment, history,
lifestyle, media, sport, science, and world topics. Questions included in the
quiz have been written by representatives in Belgium, Estonia, India, USA and
the UK, with help from Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, and Norway.
Additional countries that will be participating in the quiz include
Bangladesh, Canada, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Liberia, Lithuania, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland with more being added.  
  
The Chicago locale will be hosted by Paul Bailey, the US lead represenative of
the World Quizzing Championships who will be coming to Chicago.  
  
What sort of questions will the competitors face, or more to the point, what
won't be asked? This is the antithesis of a pub quiz, it is instead a global
quiz for a global audience. Don't expect questions about local TV soap operas,
local politics or any other local interest stories. Do expect questions about
mythology, the Olympic Games, Disney films, the Solar System, wildlife, and
Nobel Laureates; in short, expect questions for which participants from Buenos
Aries, Monrovia, or Sydney might possibly know the answers. Sample questions
can be found at
[http://www.wqc2009.com/2.html](\\http://www.wqc2009.com/2.html\\")  
  
The World Quizzing Championships will consist of 200 questions divided into
eight broad subjects. There is no cost to participate though participants are
strongly encouraged to RSVP in advance. To RSVP, email
