_A single person stands on stage, holding a customer-response envelope made by the Microsoft Corporation._

The Microsoft Corporation ranks as one of the richest corporations of all
time. Microsoft is the first company to exceed five-hundred billion dollars in
market value. If Microsoft were a country, it would be the ninth largest
country in the world, trailing behind the five-hundred-fifty-three billion
dollar Gross Domestic Product value of Spain.

And I think I know why Microsoft is so rich. And it has nothing to do with
software success or effective marketability.

My sister recently bought a PC, so naturally it's chock-full of Microsoft
software. My sister had to fill out a warranty form and send it back to
Microsoft, and Microsoft was kind enough to provide _(shows the envelope)_ a
handy business-sized response envelope, just like this one.

But while a lot of other companies--most of them nowhere near as profitable as
Microsoft--include postage-free envelopes, with a "postage will be paid by
addressee" label, Microsoft doesn't have such a label. Their envelopes are
marked with a handy little reminder: "Place stamp here."
