In a [pair](http://flowtv.org/?p=911) of [previous columns](http://flowtv.org/?p=1177) for FlowTV.org, I've outlined the
concerns over the conversion of television across the United States to an all-
digital format, required by law to occur on February 18, 2009. While many of
the benefits of the conversion have been touted, many of the growing concerns
and problems involved with the conversion and its aftermath for perhaps 50
million American analog TV viewers have seen little light. While publicity and
awareness have been increasing, that has not translated into improved actions.
Indeed, we are now less than one year until the time the conversion is to take
place and we stand well shy of the effort needed for a smooth conversion.
Instead we are seeing the makings of a perfect storm on the DTV front, which
like other perfect storms could leave a trail of ruin in its wake.

**Countdown to education, or to disaster?**

The media business press is reporting that the FCC is telling TV broadcasters
to significantly escalate awareness of the digital conversion, which includes
the following:

- Setting minimum requirements of public service announcements at all times of the broadcast day, and increasing the number of announcements as we get closer to February 18. 

- Having broadcasters display a "crawl" (as it's called) scroll at the bottom of TV screens, along with a "countdown clock" in the days before February 18.

If broadcasters abide by these mandates -- and that's not a given, since
commercial broadcasters have a history of fiercely fighting public service
mandates -- it could rank as a coordinated awareness campaign without parallel
in American television broadcasting history. (By comparison, the commercial
blackout on TV lasted for a couple of weeks at most; the DTV awareness
campaign stands to last three months long.) But publicity and awareness don't
necessarily translate into informed decision-making power, which surveys say
more than anything is what consumers want most out of this, and which surveys
also say consumers are not getting amid the DTV conversion.

**Panic at the voucher program for converter boxes?**

There had been a long-touted voucher program, with more than a billion dollars
allotted to fund coupons that would offset the costs of digital-to-analog
converter boxes for eligible households. But among the very problems with this
program, one very frightening problem has come to light: the coupons have an
expiration date in May.

[Consumers Union](http://www.hearusnow.org/homepage/00tvradio/consumersunioncallsonntiacongresstoaddressexpirationofdtvconvertercoupons/) reported
that the coupons in the voucher program have a 90-day expiration date from the
date when the first coupons are mailed out by the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration (NTIA), the government agency tasked with
administering the voucher program. With the first coupons going out in late
February 2009, all of the coupons expire sometime in late May. Why Congress
included an expiration date on the coupon program remains unclear, but what
could be very clear is that the program that's the lynchpin for helping
consumers most could prove utterly useless in late 2008 and early 2009 when
it's most pressingly needed.

Incidentally, the head of the NTIA, Meredith Baker, has left the NTIA, and
became the second NTIA head to leave the agency in five months (previous head
John Kneuer left right before Thanksgiving 2007).

**DTV technology is in stores now, but do consumers know and can they afford it?**

Meanwhile, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the trade lobby of
commercial broadcasters, has been calling for digital converters to be sold in
grocery stores to make digital converter box access easier for consumers.
Whether or not this proposal will translate into tangible action remains to be
seen.

**Small broadcasters weigh in with a big lawsuit and a big problem**

And the entire voucher program is facing a lawsuit, curiously enough, by
broadcasters themselves. The Community Broadcasters Association (CBA) -- an
organization representing some 2,600 low-power TV stations -- is suing the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over a ban of convertor boxes that
don't also allow for analog signals.

CBA member stations aren't affected by the 2009 conversion; small broadcasters
don't have to convert to digital until the year 2012. But consumers who
receive CBA-member TV signals may not realize that installing the converter
boxes would have the unintended effect of blocking analog signals from still-
analog low-power TV stations.

In other words, the entire converter box program, which was intended to help
those people, might well have the ironic and unintended effect of shutting off
television for millions of Americans. And while many people justifiably
criticize TV as being a "vast wasteland" (to borrow Newton Minow's famous
phrase), most Americans still rely on TV as their main source of news,
weather, and emergency information.

**The DTV tsunami threatens localism.**

This is a particularly acute concern since CBA's member stations address those
audiences most likely to lose TV access as a result of the DTV conversion --
rural communities, underserved urban communities, the elderly, and those
communities that don't speak English. A catch-22 thus ensues: If you get a
convertor, you might lose TV by blocking your nearby small-power analog
stations. If you don't participate, you lose TV by not getting the big boys
who will go all digital in 2009.

**Calls for a DTV test market finally win muster, but is it too late?**

For years, there had been calls, including by FCC Commissioner [Michael Copps](http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6516513.html), for a small-
scale test of the DTV conversion to better understand the likely impact of the
DTV conversion as currently set up. The calls went little heeded, but in early
March 2008, FCC chair [Kevin Martin](http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6538022.html) -- who
previously dismissed requests for such a test as not having enough time to
prove effective -- has announced his willingness to pursue a test.

The calls are also being echoed in Congress on a bipartisan basis. In mid-
March 2008, Florida Republican representative [Cliff Stearns](http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6540845.html), a
member of the House Telecommunications & Internet Subcommittee, has also gone
on record saying he would like to see an advance test in place.

While it is heartening to see such calls for a test finally gain some serious
momentum, one has to wonder: Why wait until 11 months before the nationwide
DTV conversion is scheduled to take place to hold a test? And moreover, even
if a test can be held, and reveals gaps in the implementation of the
conversion, can action be taken in time to remedy those gaps?

**10 months of DTV Tsunami "surprises" still await**

All of the developments in this article have come to light just in the last
two months. Few of them have been positive.

With ten months to remain before perhaps the most impactful technical change
in the history of American television, and the conversion in the U.S. itself
resembling a Keystone Kops film, what other surprises lie in wait? And, most
crucially of all, can Americans respond in time?
