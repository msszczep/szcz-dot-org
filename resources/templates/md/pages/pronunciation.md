Many people who have little or no background or experience with Polish or
other Slavic languages have trouble pronouncing my last name: "Szczepanczyk".  
  
If you read the International Phonetic Alphabet, I pronounce my last name as
follows:  
  

### [ʃtʃɪp**ɑɪ**ntʃɪk]

but the crude pronunciation guide I sometimes offer in emails renders my last
name as [shchih-PINE-chick], and it is very often the first syllable --
indeed, the front of the syllable, or what phoneticians term the syllable
"onset" -- which flummoxes most people.  
  
"sz" in Polish is pronounced like the "sh" sound in English words like "shirt"
and "shoes". "cz" in Polish is prounced like the "ch" sound in English words
like "cheese" and "chicken".  
  
This fricative-affricate sound sequence ("sh" followed immediately by "ch")
can occur in English -- for example, in the phrase "fresh cheese". But the key
difference there is that the sound sequence occurs _across_ words, rather than
in a single word or, as is the case with my last name, in a single syllable
onset.  
  
If you'd like to hear the pronunciation firsthand, [here is an MP3 audio file](http://www.szcz.org/audio/szczepanczyk_twice.mp3) where I pronounce my
last name twice.
